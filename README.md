Classic Snake Game
This is a modern take on the classic Snake game, built with HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS for utility classes), and JavaScript. It features improved graphics, sound effects, and a responsive design suitable for both desktop and mobile devices.

Features
Classic Gameplay: Control a snake to eat food and grow, avoiding walls and its own tail.

Enhanced Graphics:

Gradient fills and subtle shadows for the snake and food for a more modern look.

Detailed snake head with eyes and a forked tongue.

Dynamic particle effects when food is eaten.

Immersive Sound:

Background music that plays during gameplay.

Sound effects for snake movement, eating food, and game over.

Highly Playable on Mobile: Optimized with responsive design and dedicated on-screen touch controls for seamless gameplay on mobile phones and tablets.

Standard Cursor: The mouse cursor remains the default arrow, providing a consistent user experience.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the game structure.

CSS3 (Tailwind CSS): For styling and responsive layout.

JavaScript (ES6+): For game logic and interactivity.

Tone.js: A web audio framework for dynamic sound generation.

(Optional) Firebase Authentication (Anonymous): The code retains minimal Firebase setup to handle potential Canvas environment requirements, but no data is persisted or tracked.

How to Play
Start: Click the "Start Game" button to begin.

Movement:

Desktop: Use the Arrow Keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) or W, A, S, D keys to change the snake's direction.

Mobile: Use the on-screen directional buttons (↑, ←, →, ↓) for intuitive touch control.

Objective: Guide the snake to eat the red food. Each food item eaten increases your score.

Avoid: Do not hit the walls or the snake's own body. Hitting either will end the game.

Speed Increase: The snake will gradually speed up as your score increases.

Pause/Resume: Click the "Pause Game" button to temporarily stop and resume the game.

Reset: Click the "Reset Game" button to restart the game from the beginning.

Setup for Development
To run this game locally:

Save the File: Save the provided HTML code as index.html (or any .html filename).

Open in Browser: Open the index.html file directly in your web browser. A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) is recommended.

Note: While the code includes minimal Firebase imports, this version of the game does not use Firestore for high score persistence or any other data storage. The Firebase setup is primarily for compatibility with environments that might auto-inject Firebase configurations.
